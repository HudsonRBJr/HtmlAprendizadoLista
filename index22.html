        <hr>
        <p id="p25">HTML semântico é o uso de marcação HTML para reforçar a semântica, ou significado, das informações em páginas da Web e aplicativos da Web, em vez de meramente definir sua apresentação ou aparência. O HTML semântico é processado por navegadores da Web tradicionais, bem como por muitos outros agentes de usuário.
